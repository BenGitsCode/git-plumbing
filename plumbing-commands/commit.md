# What's in a commit?

Before we talk about what's in a commit. We have to talk a little about what git is first. Git is a stupid content tracker that speaks in blobs. Everything is a blob object identified by a SHA-1 hash or a reserved name in git.

Much of what the porcelain commands do for us, is making this translation of objects into commits, branches, etc.
